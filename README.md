Data visualization of birds spotted in the United States in the past year. (2017)

Data : 
- species-name
- count

The visualisation is a map of the United States. 
Color is really recognizable and imporatant for these animals. 
Because of that you can see at this map the birds in color-swatches. 

The size of the color swatches is the count of the birds who are spotted. 
The color-swatches are on the specific location placed where they are spotted. 

At the poster you can see a index. In this index you can see the swatches with the species-name of the birds.
